### Architecture
The Gym Management Web Application is built using the ASP.NET MVC framework, ensuring a structured and scalable approach to web application development.

#### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
- **Model**: Manages the business logic and database interactions, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **View**: Handles the presentation layer, rendering user interfaces for various functionalities.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user requests and updating the Model.

#### Database Design
The database design follows normalization principles to minimise redundancy and ensure data integrity. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the database structure, defining primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between tables.
